# Numerical-Calculation-Double-Integral
The assignment concerns the calculation of the double integral of the function $f(x,y)\,=\,x^2+y^3$ over a domain with y limits [x,2x] and x limits [0,1]:
$$ I=\int_0^1\int_x^{2x}x^2+y^3\,dydx $$
Two different approaches are used: Simpson's rule, which is a numerical calculation, and Monte Carlo integration. 
The specific integral defines the volume that is enclosed in the space between the surfaces: y=x, y=2x, x=0, x=1 and z=$x^2+y^3$. Although its analytical solution is trivial, Simpson's one - third rule and Monte Carlo integration are applied, too, in order to be learned and tested.
